      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Quality-for-startups">&lt;p&gt;Do you sometimes wonder how to balance quality and rapid feedback? This is a common problem where most startups stumble upon. In the early stages, a start-up is in great need of quick feedback to validate their ideas. Sooner then later it becomes very clear that first impressions and quality are crucial to keeping the customer engaged and willing to keep using the product in its early stages. Let’s dig deeper into this topic and think together of ideas on how to balance this hard equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the spread of the lean startup methodology, startups focus on using as few resources as possible to develop a minimum viable product. First, because the entrepreneur cannot afford to spend a large number of resources. Secondly, because the entrepreneur still has not reached a product-market fit. While this is a logical method for early startups especially when feedback is needed. However, let’s build a case for the importance of quality in the early stages of a startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: While this article is written for startups running a software product, its key ideas would be relevant to all product building startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-you-should-consider-quality-for-your-product&quot;&gt;Why you should consider quality for your product?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-impressions-matter&quot;&gt;First Impressions Matter:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need to build a good first impression in terms of quality, service, and support. According to some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/digital-transformation-reality-80-of-customers-delete-apps-that-dont-meet-expectations/#:~:text=The%20study%20shows%20that%2060,that%20many%20companies%20are%20doing.&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;, up to 80% of users abandon using an app or website after a single usage. This number is super scary especially if you plan to collect a lot of feedback. Users who abandon your product will not be keen on sending feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need to focus on earning your users’ trust. This needs to be achieved with a great first impression. This helps keep your users engaged and willing to use new updated versions of your product, also more willing to provide feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;financial-loss-or-gain&quot;&gt;Financial Loss or Gain:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your product is more than likely going to include some flows which help generate revenue. If any of those flows contains an error or a bug, you have lost your self some crucial sales. It is estimated that losses from software failures accumulate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tricentis.com/resources/software-fail-watch-5th-edition/&quot;&gt;17 trillion dollars per year&lt;/a&gt;. While this is a number that is hard to grasp, trust me you do not want to be one of the startups who lose money or even worse, fail due to some lousy error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-you-embed-quality-within-your-startup&quot;&gt;How can you embed quality within your startup?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on your resources and willingness to integrate quality within your startups, here are your options in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hire-someone-within-the-team-to-focus-on-quality&quot;&gt;Hire someone within the team to focus on quality:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimally hire someone whose main focus is quality within your team. It is extremely healthy to have strong bias forces within your organization. Each force would push towards one end of the spectrum including delivery, scalability, and quality, eventually balancing the equation. In an optimal scenario, we will have the product team pushing towards delivery, the development team pushing towards scalability, and finally, the quality team pushing towards quality. Once all three forces are empowered, the result would be a well-balanced product in terms of speed, maintainability, and quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;build-a-quality-culture&quot;&gt;Build a quality culture:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your second option would be to build a quality culture allowing your team to wear the quality hat. While this is hard to achieve, it is necessary even if you have a quality team on board. This essentially means to empower the team to question everything from a quality perspective. How does the feature work? What could go wrong? What hypothetical scenarios could happen? Is the feature easy to use? Simply, training the team to ask these kinds of questions is a great way to improve quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training the team and yourself could also be achieved by hiring a quality team to ingrain the quality culture on a day-to-day basis. This can also be achieved through dedicated training by an experienced trainer who has deep experience with developing a quality culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottomline while speed and feedback are crucial and necessary for a startup in its early days. However, ingraining some quality practices and developing a quality culture within the team and yourself is extremely important to build your users’ trust and engagement levels. Eventually, this will be translated into rich feedback and increased revenue.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
